pidout-327307.txt and pidout-6537.txt have a small number of crazy outliers (due to mis-calibrations).
pidout-649951.txt does not have these outliers.

pidout-?M?.txt are a 5M event file broken down into 3 smaller files.
These files have slightly stricter cuts to remove some pions that got labeled as protons (since some events have a proton and pion with very similar kinematics they are hard to separate even in a simulation).
